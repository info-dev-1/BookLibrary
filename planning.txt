This file contains some planning for the reading comparison feature and its implementation.

I'll try boolean for Genre rather than an enum - two constants for fiction and nonfiction.



Structure of the code:

ReadingListComparisonDriver has-a ...Processor and a ...UserInterface.
That Driver class does high-level logic and coordination.

The Processor handles logic to process/perform the comparison features.

The UI class handles input from user and output to the user.



Important:

Some documentation somewhere will need to explain how "user" will be the user of the library management system,
and "person" (1 or 2) will be a person whose reading list we are comparing to.



TODO: perhaps create a class, ReadingListDataStore, to hold the reading lists. That way I pass a reference type, not ArrayList<Book> so frequently
(and so I don't repeat myself three times, for the pair of reading lists as class fields.)

I know I have a lot of code written w/o testing. I will wrap things up, then test it, section-by-section.
