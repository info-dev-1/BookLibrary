This file contains some planning for the reading comparison feature and its implementation.

I'll try boolean for Genre rather than an enum - two constants for fiction and nonfiction.



Structure of the code:

ReadingListComparisonDriver has-a ...Processor and a ...UserInterface.
That Driver class does high-level logic and coordination.

The Processor handles logic to process/perform the comparison features.

The UI class handles input from user and output to the user.



Important:

Some documentation somewhere will need to explain how "user" will be the user of the library management system,
and "person" (1 or 2) will be a person whose reading list we are comparing to.
