This file contains some planning for the reading comparison feature and its implementation.

I'll try boolean for Genre rather than an enum - two constants for fiction and nonfiction.



Structure of the code:

ReadingListComparisonDriver has-a ...Processor and a ...UserInterface.
That Driver class does high-level logic and coordination.

The Processor handles logic to process/perform the comparison features.

The UI class handles input from user and output to the user.



Important:

Some documentation somewhere will need to explain how "user" will be the user of the library management system,
and "person" (1 or 2) will be a person whose reading list we are comparing to.



TODO: perhaps create a class, ReadingListDataStore, to hold the reading lists. That way I pass a reference type, not ArrayList<Book> so frequently
(and so I don't repeat myself three times, for the pair of reading lists as class fields.)
(done)

I know I have a lot of code written w/o testing. I will wrap things up, then test it, section-by-section.


9/29
"significant majority" of books are [fiction/non-fiction], indicating a possible preference for [fiction or non-fiction]
option:
1. compute majority, and report that in the statistics explanation.
2. compute "preference", and report the description above.
I like 2.

thus, options:
1. call the genre preference "genre preference"
2. call it "signifiant majority"
I like 1.

NOTE: if the person does meet the preference level for fiction or nonfiction, then I would have the app output,
"this person has about the same number of fiction and nonfiction books on their list." (or something similar)



TODO:
 - format the percentage books in common, to be an actual percentage.
 - make an enum for genre preference and use it. (Done)
